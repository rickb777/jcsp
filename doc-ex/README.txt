These directories hold the examples used in the javadoc for
the main JCSP library.  The structure of these directories
mirrors those in the library.  Main programs are included,
so everything can be compiled and run:

  * change into any of the directories with .java files;
  * javac *java;
  * java (i.e. run) the ones with main methods.
