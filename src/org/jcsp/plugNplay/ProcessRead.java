/**
 * Reads one <TT>Object</TT> from its input channel.
 * <H2>Process Diagram</H2>
 * <p><img src="doc-files/ProcessRead1.gif"></p>
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * <TT>ProcessRead</TT> is a process that performs a single read
 * from its <TT>in</TT> channel and then terminates.  It stores
 * the read <TT>Object</TT> in the public <TT>value</TT> field of
 * this process (which is safe to examine <I>after</I> the process
 * has terminated and <I>before</I> it is next run).
 * <P>
 * <TT>ProcessRead</TT> declaration, construction and use should normally
 * be localised within a single method -- so we feel no embarassment about
 * its public field.  Its only (envisaged) purpose is as described in
 * the example below.
 * <H2>Channel Protocols</H2>
 * <TABLE BORDER="2">
 *   <TR>
 *     <TH COLSPAN="3">Input Channels</TH>
 *   </TR>
 *   <TR>
 *     <TH>in</TH>
 *     <TD>java.lang.Object</TD>
 *     <TD>
 *       The in Channel can accept data of any Class.
 *     </TD>
 *   </TR>
 * </TABLE>
 * <H2>Example</H2>
 * <TT>ProcessRead</TT> is designed to simplify <I>reading in parallel</I>
 * from channels.  Make as many instances as there
 * are channels, binding each instance to a different channel,
 * together with a {@link org.jcsp.lang.Parallel} object in which to run them:
 * <PRE>
 *   ChannelInput in0, in1;
 *   .
 *   .
 *   .
 *   ProcessRead read0 = new ProcessRead (in0);
 *   ProcessRead read1 = new ProcessRead (in1);
 *   CSProcess parRead01 = new Parallel (new CSProcess[] {in0, in1});
 * </PRE>
 * The above is best done <I>once</I>, before any looping over the
 * parallel read commences.  A parallel read can now be performed
 * at any time (and any number of times) by executing:
 * <PRE>
 *     parRead01.run ();
 * </PRE>
 * This terminates when, and only when, both reads have completed --
 * the events may occur in <I>any</I> order.  The values read may then
 * be found in <TT>read0.value</TT> and <TT>read1.value</TT>, where they
 * may be safely accessed up until the time that <TT>parRead01</TT> is run again.
