/**
 * Writes one <TT>Object</TT> to its output channel.
 * <H2>Process Diagram</H2>
 * <p><img src="doc-files\ProcessWrite1.gif"></p>
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * <TT>ProcessWrite</TT> is a process that performs a single write
 * to its <TT>out</TT> channel and then terminates.  The <TT>Object</TT>
 * that is written must first be placed in the public <TT>value</TT> field
 * of this process (which is safe to set <I>before</I> and <I>in between</I>
 * process runs).
 * <P>
 * <TT>ProcessWrite</TT> declaration, construction and use should normally
 * be localised within a single method -- so we feel no embarassment about
 * its public field.  Its only (envisaged) purpose is as described in
 * the example below.
 * <H2>Channel Protocols</H2>
 * <TABLE BORDER="2">
 *   <TR>
 *     <TH COLSPAN="3">Output Channels</TH>
 *   </TR>
 *   <TR>
 *     <TH>out</TH>
 *     <TD>java.lang.Object</TD>
 *     <TD>
 *       The out Channel can accept data of any Class.
 *     </TD>
 *   </TR>
 * </TABLE>
 * <H2>Example</H2>
 * <TT>ProcessWrite</TT> is designed to simplify <I>writing in parallel</I>
 * to channels.  Make as many instances as there
 * are channels, binding each instance to a different channel,
 * together with a {@link org.jcsp.lang.Parallel} object in which to run them:
 * <PRE>
 *   ChannelOutput out0, out1;
 *   .
 *   .
 *   .
 *   ProcessWrite write0 = new ProcessWrite (out0);
 *   ProcessWrite write1 = new ProcessWrite (out1);
 *   CSProcess parWrite01 = new Parallel (new CSProcess[] {out0, out1});
 * </PRE>
 * The above is best done <I>once</I>, before any looping over the
 * parallel write commences.  A parallel write can now be performed
 * at any time (and any number of times) by executing:
 * <PRE>
 *     write0.value = ...;   // whatever we want sent down out0
 *     write1.value = ...;   // whatever we want sent down out1
 *     parWrite01.run ();
 * </PRE>
 * The last line above terminates when, and only when, both writes have completed --
 * the events may occur in <I>any</I> order.
