This provides classes and interfaces to customise the semantics of <TT>int</TT> channels.
<P>
By default, channels are zero-buffered and fully synchronised: both a reader
and a writer have to be ready for a communication to proceed.  Whoever
gets to the communication point first has to wait for the other party.
<P>
This package provides a variety of classes conforming
to the {@link org.jcsp.util.ints.ChannelDataStoreInt} interface.
These classes can be used as <I>plug-ins</I> to the <TT>static</TT> channel
{@link org.jcsp.lang.One2OneChannelInt#create(org.jcsp.util.ints.ChannelDataStoreInt) <TT>create</TT>}
methods to customise its semantics.  Classes are provided for blocking FIFO buffers,
overwriting buffers (losing either the newest or oldest data) and
infinite (within the realms of your virtual memory) buffers.
<P>
Users may write and use their own implementations of
the {@link org.jcsp.util.ints.ChannelDataStoreInt} interface, but
great care must be taken to specify its semantics.
It should not normally be necessary to do this.
