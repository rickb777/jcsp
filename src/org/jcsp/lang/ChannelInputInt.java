/**
 * This defines the interface for reading from object channels.
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * <TT>ChannelInput</TT> defines the interface for reading from object channels.
 * The interface contains three methods:
 * {@link #read <code>read</code>}, {@link #startRead <code>startRead</code>} and
 * {@link #endRead <code>endRead</code>}.
 * The {@link #read <code>read</code>} and {@link #startRead <code>startRead</code>}
 * methods block until an <TT>Object</TT> has been written
 * to the channel by a process at the other end.  If an <TT>Object</TT> has
 * already been written when this method is called, the method will return
 * without blocking.  Either way, the methods return the <TT>Object</TT>
 * sent down the channel.
 * <P>
 * When a {@link #read <code>read</code>} completes, the matching
 * {@link ChannelOutputInt#write <code>write</code>} method (invoked by
 * the writing process) also completes.
 * When a {@link #startRead <code>startRead</code>} completes, the matching
 * {@link ChannelOutputInt#write <code>write</code>} method does not complete
 * until the reader process invokes an {@link #endRead <code>endRead</code>}.
 * Actions performed by the reader in between a {@link #startRead <code>startRead</code>}
 * and {@link #endRead <code>endRead</code>} make up an <i>extended rendezvous</i>.
 * 
 * <P>
 * <TT>ChannelInputInt</TT> variables are used to hold integer channels
 * that are going to be used only for <I>input</I> by the declaring process.
 * This is a security matter -- by declaring a <TT>ChannelInputInt</TT>
 * interface, any attempt to <I>output</I> to the channel will generate
 * a compile-time error.  For example, the following code fragment will
 * not compile:
 *
 * <PRE>
 * void doWrite (ChannelInputInt c, int i) {
 *   c.write (i);   // illegal
 * }
 * </PRE>
 *
 * When configuring a <TT>CSProcess</TT> with input integer channels, they should
 * be declared as <TT>ChannelInputInt</TT> (or, if we wish to be able to make
 * choices between events, as <TT>AltingChannelInputInt</TT>)
 * variables.  The actual channel passed,
 * of course, may belong to <I>any</I> channel class that implements
 * <TT>ChannelInputInt</TT> (or <TT>AltingChannelInputInt</TT>).
 * <H2>Example</H2>
 * <H3>Discard data</H3>
 * <PRE>
 * void doRead (ChannelInputInt c) {
 *   c.read ();                       // clear the channel
 * }
 * </PRE>

     * has completed its extended action.  This method starts
     * an extended rendezvous.  When a writer to this channel
     * writes, this method returns what was sent immediately.
     * The extended rendezvous continues with reader actions
     * until the reader invokes {@link #endRead <code>endRead</code>}.
     * Only then will the writer be released (from its
     * {@link ChannelOutputInt#write <code>write</code>} method).
